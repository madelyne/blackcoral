Welcome, Brown Scholars! I can't wait to embark on what promises to be a great year of learning, coding, and coral-ing. 

I'll be posting general tips and tricks for terminal, python, and more in this directory ('notes-and-tools'). You can also find my contact info below: 

email: madelyne.xiao96@gmail.com 
cell/text: (301) 676-2371 

Remember to *email me* if you know you're running late to or must miss a class; the earlier you notify me, the better! I'll also be posting polls before and after class to take stock of our progress and learn a bit more about you along the way.

Here's the group, as we currently stand: 

Anum Jabeen
Sophia Podolsky
Helena Rajalingam
Lizbeth Samaniego
Angelica Schell
Kelly Zhou

TEAM NAME: tba!
